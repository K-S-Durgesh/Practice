    <h1>What is an HTML Element</h1>
    <p>Elements are the fundamentals of HyperText Markup Language (HTML). Each HTML document is made of elements that are specified using tags.

        HTML elements and HTML tags are often confused. The tags are used to open and close the object, whereas the element includes both tags and its content. <br/> <br/> Letâ€™s consider an example with the (h1) tag: (h1) Title of the document (/h1) - is an element, and (h1), (/h1) - are tags.

    <p>HTML elements can come in <strong>pairs or be empty.</strong> The paired elements have an opening (<>) and (</>) closing tags, and the content of the element is placed in between them. <br/> <img <a href="https://youtu.be/RnfuJRtFQD8"src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/08/html.png" alt="HTML-image" width="10%" hight="10%"></a </p>
